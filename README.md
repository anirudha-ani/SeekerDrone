# SeekerDrone

The project aims to accelerate the policy learning process in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) by implementing a unique reward mechanism. This reward mechanism utilizes a natural language spatial object search query that scans and assigns partial rewards to the corresponding Deep RL model. The implementation of this mechanism is expected to help improve the accuracy and speed of policy learning in RL models.

To test the efficacy of the developed Neural Network model, the project created a custom simulation in Unity and tested the model on Microsoft Airsim drone. The simulation helped in replicating real-world scenarios, providing an accurate representation of the model's performance. The testing phase was successful, and the developed model showed promising results.

The project has been recognized for its innovation and excellence in the field of computer vision. Among 100+ students, it won the best project in Computer Vision class, highlighting the project's significance and potential for future applications in the field.

Overall, this project offers a unique and effective solution to the challenges faced in the RL model's policy learning process. With promising results and recognition, it has the potential to contribute significantly to the field of computer vision and beyond.
